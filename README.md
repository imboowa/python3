# Demo Clock Program

## Overview
This is a simple Python program that prints the current time to the console at regular intervals. It demonstrates basic time-handling functionality using Python's standard libraries like the time module. This program does not include a graphical user interface; all output is displayed in the terminal or console.

## Features
- Displays the current time in **Weeks : Days : Hours : Minutes : Seconds** format.
- Updates the time continuously at regular intervals.
- Demonstrates basic usage of Python's `time` library.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- A terminal or console to run the script

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the program files.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run the program using the following command:
   ```bash
   python fileName.py
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python3 fileName.py
   ```
5. The current time will be printed to the console at regular intervals.

## Notes
- Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the program.
- The program continuously doesn't overwrite the time on the same line but prints the time line per line.
